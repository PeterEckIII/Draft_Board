#Fantasy Football Draft Board
This app was created in order to handle a fantasy football draft board in real-time. I wanted to make this for my fantasy football league, as we're always arguing about getting a physical board or not and how we'll pay for it, etc etc ad inifitum.

## React
I decided to bootstrap the project with `create-react-app` and use React due to the component structure. Being able to write one player card and add data for hundreds of players was a huge reason for this decision.
